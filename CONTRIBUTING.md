# Contributing

To start new work, first add a row to `ROADMAP.md` describing the epic and next action. Then, create a matching card in the GitHub Project (see `.github/project.yml`). Reference the epic in your branch and PR description (e.g., `Closes GUI-1`). This ensures progress is tracked and updates are automated.
